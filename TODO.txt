TODO

- [ ] Get content from JSON in columns
- [ ] Model layout and JSON content for that 
- [ ] Icons for each section? Ie. Programming laptop, art paintpad etc
- [ ] About me page? At the bottom or maybe a popout window from somewhere
- [ ] Click outside model to close
- [ ] Model button should be bigger on mobile
- [ ] Check Wave and go through all the accessibility things (mostly just adding labels to stuff)
- [ ] Nav bar could do with rearranging below a certain width. Text could get smaller?


DONE
- [x] Apply model click to all items
- [x] Model items as object and display information from each items
- [x] Make a nav bar style thing at the bottom of the page that jumps you to specific sections (only visible in mobile view)
